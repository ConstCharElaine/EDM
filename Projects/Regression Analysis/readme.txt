An Analysis of Regression Models for Predicting Academic Performance

In this study, we will examine the efficacy of various regression models for predicting students' final grade in a single course using chronological subsets of students' individual grades. We are interested in exploring the rate at which prediction error decreases as grades from later in the course are added to the training dataset as well as the machine learning models that yield the best predictive performance. The full set of grades from a semester-long data structures course will provide the data from which 5 subsets of data will be constructed, each representing various stages of completion of the course.
